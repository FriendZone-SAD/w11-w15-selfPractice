ผมให้แชท gen โจทย์มาให้แล้วผมทำตามครับผม

Self-Practice: JavaScript Date/Time
Task 1: Create Date Objects

Create a Date object for the current time using two different methods.

Create a Date object for your birthday (pick any date) using:

A string in ISO8601 format.

The new Date(year, monthIndex, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond) format.

Check: Print both using console.log().

Task 2: Extract Date Components

Using a Date object (any date you created):

Print the year, month, day of month, day of week, hour, minute, and second using .getFullYear(), .getMonth(), etc.

Notice the month is 0-indexed. Adjust it to show 1–12.

Task 3: UTC vs Local Time

Create a Date object for '2025-12-25T10:00:00+07:00' (local time in Bangkok).

Convert it to UTC using .toISOString().

Print both the local and UTC versions.

Task 4: Formatting Dates

Using toLocaleString():

Display the date in Thai format (th-TH), English (UK) (en-GB), and English (US) (en-US) with Bangkok timezone.

Using Intl.DateTimeFormat:

Display the same date in full date + short time format in Bangkok.

Include weekday and month in long format.

Task 5: Compare Dates

Create two Date objects:

start = '2025-11-02T10:00:00+07:00'

end = '2025-11-02T09:00:00+08:00'

Convert both to UTC and compare them using getTime(). Which is later?

Task 6: Overlapping Time Check

Create two booking periods:

Booking A: 1 Nov 2025 00:00 → 5 Nov 2025 00:00

Booking B: 2 Nov 2025 00:00 → 4 Nov 2025 00:00

Write a function isOverlapping(startA, endA, startB, endB) to check if the periods overlap.

Test your function with the above dates. Print the result.

Task 7: Booking Validation

Assume the system is open: 2 Nov 2025 08:00 → 2 Nov 2025 17:00 (Bangkok time).

A user tries to book 2 Nov 2025 09:00 → 2 Nov 2025 17:00.

Write an if statement to validate if the booking is within the allowed time. Print "Valid Booking" or "Invalid Booking".

✅ Bonus Challenge:
Detect the user’s system timezone and locale using Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions() and print it.
