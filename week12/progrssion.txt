Week 12: DOM + Date/Time Practice
Scenario

You are creating a simple Booking System Preview page. Users can:

Pick a date/time for a booking.

See if the booking is valid based on open/close hours.

See if the booking overlaps with existing bookings.

Display all dates in local format in the page.

Tasks (to do in JS)

Task 1 – Show Current Date/Time

Display the current date/time in local format on the page.

Update every second.

Task 2 – Booking Input

Create 2 input fields for start and end datetime.

Add a button “Check Booking”.

Task 3 – Validate Booking Hours

Assume system open time: 08:00 → 17:00 (Bangkok time).

When the user clicks “Check Booking”, check if the start and end are within open hours.

Display "Valid Booking" or "Invalid Booking" on the page.

Task 4 – Overlapping Check

Hardcode existing booking: 2025-11-02T09:00 → 2025-11-02T12:00.

When the user clicks “Check Booking”, also check if the new booking overlaps the existing one.

Display "Booking overlaps existing booking" or "No overlap" on the page.

Task 5 – Format Display

Display the booking times formatted in local time (toLocaleString) under the inputs.
